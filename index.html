                Hi, my name is Sienna Boos! I am a second-year student at Northeastern University in the John Martinson Honors Program pursuing a combined major in Data Science and International Affairs, as well as a minor in Biology.

                My academic and professional interests include AI ethics and governance, tech policy, and utilizing data to enact positive social change. I am passionate about the legal and ethical implications of transformative technologies like artificial intelligence and gene editing, and I plan to explore these subjects further in law school after completing my degree.

                I am involved in a number of clubs on campus, including Her Campus Magazine, of which I am Site Manager, Feminist Student Organization, of which I am Social Media Manager, and the AI and Data Ethics Working Group (AIDE). Last summer, I did a study abroad program in Belgium: “Data and Software in International Government and Politics.”

                Outside of the classroom, I have two sisters and a Boston Terrier named Lucy. I love reading (especially fantasy books), journaling, and exploring Boston coffee shops.

                As a highly interdisciplinary learner, I am excited to find avenues that allow me to combine my literacy skills and my technical background, and I would love to connect with others who are similarly committed to equitable innovation. Let’s chat!
