                [I am interested in the growing field of AI governance and technology law. I am passionate about making technological innovation equitable, safe, and responsibly implemented. I see how powerful innovation can be—and I also recognize that with great power comes great responsibility.

When I first arrived at Northeastern, I started out as a Data Science and Biology major because I love learning about science and technology. Plus, reading and writing always came more naturally to me than STEM, so I wanted to challenge myself. While I loved these topics, I realized that I underestimated how much I would miss reading and writing for my classes, and it felt like something was lacking from my studies.

I took a fascinating class my freshman year called “Tech and Human Values,” which initiated my fascination with tech ethics. Then, this past summer, I did a study abroad program in Belgium called Data and Software in International Government and Politics. This sparked my interest in tech policy and caused me to realize that I am more passionate about impacting how novel technologies are governed by law and learning about their societal implications than actually building those technologies myself. After this, I switched my major to Data Science and International Affairs on a Pre-Law track!
